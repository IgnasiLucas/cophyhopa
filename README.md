The DNA libraries are prepared. Eleven of them were analysed in Bioanalyser for
quality control. The concentrations of all them are also determined with Qubit.
Here I plan to check the correlation between Qubit and Bioanalyser estimations,
as well as to determine the amount of DNA that we need to pool per sample.

I compare the fluorescence profile obtained with a Bioanalyser of a product of
double digestion with the expected profile from the in silico digestions. I conclude
the in vitro digestion resembles enough the in silico one to be trusted, and
determine that the number of fragments with different ends in the size range
that can be sequenced is not likely to be larger than expected. Thus, I am
inclined to select as wide a size range as possible for sequencing. See the
report [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/IgnasiLucas/cophyhopa/blob/soca/results/2021-07-05/README.html)

There is an overview of the protocol [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/IgnasiLucas/cophyhopa/blob/soca/results/2021-01-14/protocol.html).
There are also pdf documents describing the adapters design and the detailed protocol.
This is updated as the experiment proceeds.
