Calculating genome statistics
-----------------------------
Assuming that homozygous peak is the largest in the spectra with frequency of: 51x
Homozygous peak index: 1
CAUTION: the following estimates are based on having a clean spectra and having identified the correct homozygous peak!
Estimated genome size: 5.76 Mbp
