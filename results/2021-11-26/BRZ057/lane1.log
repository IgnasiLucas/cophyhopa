Calculating genome statistics
-----------------------------
Assuming that homozygous peak is the largest in the spectra with frequency of: 105x
Homozygous peak index: 1
CAUTION: the following estimates are based on having a clean spectra and having identified the correct homozygous peak!
Estimated genome size: 0.63 Mbp
